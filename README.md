# Create React App with TypeScript

## Installation and Running

First, clone down the repo:
```bash
  https://github.com/huw121/typescript-in-react-experiment.git
```

Then change into the directory:
```bash
  cd typescript-in-react-experiment
```

To install all the required dependencies, run:
```bash
  npm install
```

Once installed, to run the app you can use the script:
```bash
  npm start
```
This should automatically open the app in your browser but alternatively you can go to http://localhost:3000/.
